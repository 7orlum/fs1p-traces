fs1p-traces
===========

A collection of USB protocol traces gathered from the official RDing USB foot switch configuration program with BusDog on Windows 8.1, while programming the RDing FS1-P USB foot switch.

## Preliminary findings
The keycode data found in the USB frames seems to contain HID keycodes, or numbers closely related to HID keycodes when programming the footswitch to be a single key.
